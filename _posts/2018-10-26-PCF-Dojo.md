title: Cloud Foundry Summit
---

As the Cloud Foundry ecosystem continues to grow and evolve, and team members rotate from one team to the next, one common scenario is that each component team build their own tools to enable faster development.  This leads to us solving the same problem in various ways.  To help consolidate the effort and create a more opinionated tool, we've taken the first step to build a community of R&D pivots who contribute to the Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

During the 2018 Cloud Foundry Summit, we were able to lead a discussion with folks from engineering to field to share their experience.  One of the outcomes of the discussion includes a potential new tool called ops-manifest  (from the Ops Manager team).  This tool allows TDD workflow by extracting the manifest validation code as a stand-alone Ruby gem to test javascript migration, manifest generation, and metadata.
